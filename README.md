Note, the code isn't neatly organized in separate modules and the API key isn't hidden like it would be if it this was not a toy app.  The purpose of this app was to showcase my custom made SVG images and animations.  The image you see may not fit what you see outside the window all the time, but it should fall in line most of the time.

Recently updated API.  Tested on Firefox and Chrome.  Be sure to turn off uBlockOrigin.

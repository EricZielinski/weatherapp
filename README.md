The purpose of this app was to showcase my custom made SVG images and animations.  The image you see may not fit what you see outside the window all the time, but it should fall in line most of the time.

Note, the code isn't neatly organized in separate modules and the API key isn't hidden like it would be if it this was not a toy app.  Part of the reason for this is because this toy app was one of the first things I built from scratch after learning the basics of programming.  It was also built before I attended my CS program.  

Most recently updated API in January 2020.  Tested on Firefox and Chrome.  Be sure to turn off uBlockOrigin.
